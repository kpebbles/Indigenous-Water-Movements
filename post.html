                     <p>The Indigenous water movements, Idle No More and Standing Rock are only two of the many that have been happening around the world. The reason this site is focusing on these two is because they were successful in making national and international news. By breaking this news barrier--from local to national and international news-- it is important to look at how these movements claimed control over their own story (rhetorical sovereinty) and were able to use social media to get information out to the larger public about the movement. </p>

                    <p>These movements used social media in a way as to get their actions noticed by the public at large and to, eventually, get national and international news networks to take notice and cover their stories. This is no small task and it is something that is indirectly shown in the timelines. As the movements grow (as they are still active and becoming more active given the recent presidential approval of both Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipeline), their outreach and unfying messages are crucial to gain widespread support.</p>

                    <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>

                    <p>This widespread support is the primary reason these movements have grown to have international meaning. By using Indigenous voices and values as a base of these movements, the concept of how the health of the earth (Turtle Island) and all of us who live and depend on access to safe, potable water makes the goal of these movements unifying. As the world sees and experiences more and more problems in rural and urban communities around the globe, people understand the importance of the need for water for survival. As a result, the focused message of life, humanity, dignity, and survival of future generations is becoming a reality for more and more people around the world. As a result, we see international community alliences forming and supporting these Indigenous water movements.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Rhetorical Sovereignty</h2>

                    <p> Lyon's Quote.</p>

                    <p> One way Rhetorical Sovereignty is used is through stories. Stories tell us and others who we are, where we come from, and reinforce our connections. These connections can be to the land, the place, relationships, and so forth. The voice and persepctive of stories is a way of showing rhetorical sovereinty. By telling a story from one's own perspective gives a person or group of people a claim on the story, expresses perspective, and claims positionality. These stories can be expressed many ways; on this website, Indigenous voices will be the focus and the sources of the news stories and creatin stories. </p>
                    <p> Creation stories do all od these things, including connecting us to the place of origin. This is shown through the "Our Land, Our Stories" page (see above in the links). In this, there is a creation stoy of the Dene people in the community of Idle No More and the Souix people of Standing Rock. These stories are a ways of connecting the people to the land and water from which they came and that support themselves. It is the land that they live in, the food they eat comes from it, The air they breathe, and the water they drink and bathe in. Their lives are their stories. Their experiences can not be seperated from their voices.</p>
